    <h2>Corbyn Edrington</h2>
    <p>Hey everybody, my name is Corbyn Edrington. I'm majoring in Computer Science
        and I also spend my time drawing, reading and playing games. I've always 
        enjoyed spending time with computers, and like to imagine programming kind of 
        like solving a puzzle; once you have all the pieces it all fits together.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints my entire life,
        so 19 years now. I'm from Spring Texas, which is just a little north of Houston, and 
        everything about it is great.. aside from the summer weather.</p>
